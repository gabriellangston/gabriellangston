         <h3><p>I am currently earning a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech.</p>
  <p> I have experience working with Python, MATLAB, and various Microsoft products.</p>
  <p> In my first semester at Georgia Tech I have gained skills in soldering and electrical design, as well as 3D modeling through the software Blender.</p>

<h1>My name is Gabriel Langston, and I am an Electrical Engineering major from Newnan, Georgia. </h1>
<h2>While I am undecided on where I want to go with my degree, I have a few interests that guide my decisions, and that have led me to where I am today.</h2>
<h3><p>From when I was six years old with my nose deep in my Gameboy Advance to now, when I spend what is probably an embarrassing amount of time on my cell phone and laptop, I have been an active user of electronic entertainment all my life.
</p><p>In an economy currently dependent on fossil fuels, the advancement of renewable energy sources seems more important that ever;  I would be honored to be able to take part in movements that aim to advance this noble effort.
</p><p>I have never been a fan of locking myself down to one discipline; I love sharpening my skill with a pen just as much as I do polishing off a difficult proof. For this reason, the field of electronic patent law is one that intrigues me; I believe that a field like this will allow me to utilize my skills in communication and reading as well as mathematics and science.
</p></h3>
<h2><p>During my first semester at Georgia Tech I have only grown more interested in all of the topics that led me to choose Electrical Engineering as my field of study. This craving to learn all that I can about these fields is one that I do not plan to lose anytime soon, and I definitely plan to carry this enthusiasm into my workplace.
